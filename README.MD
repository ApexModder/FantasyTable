### **_Special Features_**
- `/roll` command to roll in chat with a specified number similar to _World of Warcraft_ (ex: `/roll 100` will always roll out of _100_, with the roll being shown in chat)
- In addition, chat will show how many dice have been rolled (rolling _5 Six-Sided Dice_ will show like this: `<player> rolled <roll> (5d6)`)
- Paper dice that can be dyed to any combination the same way leather armor can
- Colored chat text for each dice (matches paper dice color if used)
- Dice pouches that can also be dyed like leather armor, and have 6x3 spaces in it

- **_Wood_**
- **_Stone_**

### **_Specialty Dice_** (_Requested by Devs_)
- **_Fantasy's Lucky Dice_**
  - _Lucky Rollers_ always roll _High Values_, _Unlucky Rollers_ always roll _Low Values_ (_Configurable_).
  - _Luck_ depends on who rolled the dice.
- **_Tobi's Thrice Dice_**
  - Rolls 3 times when used, result is the largest value of the three rolls.
  - Stacks to maximum of 1.
- **_Apex's NULL Dice_**
  - When rolled value gets _NULLIFIED_ and ends up negative.
